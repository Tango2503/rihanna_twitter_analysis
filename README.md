# Sentiment Analysis on Rihanna's Twitter Page

On Feb 2021, Rihanna had posted a tweet curious to know more about the latest Farm bills that were passed by the government and had received both national and international post. 
The original [tweet](https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/1356625889602199552?lang=en) has no tone of critique or support yet the Indian media berated her actions. She faced vitriol for her actions from hundreds and thousands of people (including politicians and influencers) condemning the singer’s actions and audacity to speak about ‘foreign matters’. Personal slander such as her past abusive relationship with Chris Brown and casual slut shaming are common themes amongst the replies and retweets.  

This repo contains a series of various analyses to understand the sentiment behind the most popular replies to Rihanna's infamous tweet to test the hypothesis of whether the media tends to blow things out of proportion in the name of sensationalism.
